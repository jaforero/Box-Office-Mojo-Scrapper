            "LFs are a key tool in computational linguistics and machine translation, used to represent the potential relationships between words within a language. They're essentially a type of interlingual annotation, meaning they offer a language-neutral way to describe these relationships, independent of the specific words used in any particular language.\n",

By capturing the relationships between words in collocations, LFs help us understand the meaning and nuances of these combinations, even across different languages.\n",
            "- **Translation Support:** This deeper understanding of collocations provided by LFs is invaluable for machine translation. LFs help ensure that the meaning of the original text is accurately reflected in the translated text, taking into account the subtleties of word choices and their relationships.\n",

            "\n",
            "Consider the phrase \"a **bunch** of keys.\" The collocation \"bunch of\" can be generalized across languages using the LF \"Mult,\" which expresses the idea of \"multiplicity.\" This LF can be applied to various words across languages, ensuring consistency in translation. For instance, in German, the same idea might be expressed as \"a **Haufen** Schlüssel,\" where \"Haufen\" also represents the concept of \"multiplicity.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "## Benefits of using LFs:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Improved accuracy in machine translation, especially for collocations.\n",
            "- Better understanding of word relationships and their meaning across different languages.\n",
